        violation_desc: |
          We have noticed you have recently created an s3 bucket with public access.
          If not intended, this exposes your data to external attacks and is not permitted.
          This policy violation was remediated immediately deleting the associated bucket ACL permissions.
        action_desc: |
          Please restrict your s3 access using bucket policy. Granting authenticated "FULL_CONTROL" access to AWS S3 buckets can allow other AWS accounts
          or IAM users to view, upload, modify and delete S3 objects without any restrictions.
          Exposing your S3 buckets to AWS signed accounts or users can lead to data leaks, data loss and unexpected charges for the S3 service.
          If your S3 bucket is intended to be publicly accessed, please use bucket policy to allow public access.
          Also, the Cloud Management team highly encourages the use of Amazon CloudFront to serve public traffic instead of direct s3 access.
          While this policy does not remediate object-level access we do have another policy that does.
          If your use case require allowing object-level access, "using object ACL" and the task can't be performed using bucket policy,
          please tag your buck with "pearson-public-objects" for it to be whitelisted and marked for future entitlement reviews.
