# aws-accounts-automation


AWS Organizations offers new capabilities for managing AWS accounts, including automated account creation via the Organizations API. 
For example, you can bring new development teams onboard by using the Organizations API to create an account, AWS CloudFormation templates to configure the account 
(such as for AWS Identity and Access Management [IAM] and networking), and service control policies (SCPs) to help enforce corporate policies.

In this blog post, I demonstrate the step-by-step process for end-to-end account creation in Organizations as well as how to automate the entire process.
I also show how to move a new account into an organizational unit (OU).
